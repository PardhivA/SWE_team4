 How to run the Code and Installation Instructions:
Installation: 
Prerequisites:
Node.js LTS release - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
As Node.js officially states, "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases". You can install Node.js using a version management tool (such as nvm or volta or any other of your choice) to switch between different Node.js versions.
Git for source control.
Watchman (for Linux or macOS users).
ACTION:
Open a terminal in the app’s main folder(which contains App.js, package. json)
Run the command: “npm install”. (It will install all dependencies required, like expo, react-native and so on).
Install the Expo app from the Google Play Store on the device from which you want to run the app.
Execution of Code:
In a similar terminal to the one above, Run the command “npm start”.
After some time, it will show “Starting Metro Bundler…”.
Then, once the bundling is complete, you will get a QR CODE.
Open the Expo Go app in your device and scan the QR code.
That’s it! The application is now running on your device. It is as simple as scanning a QR Code.
